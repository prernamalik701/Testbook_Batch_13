                <p>Whether travelling to work, school, or on holiday, taking water bottles with you is always a good option. They are safe and convenient to carry as you can never be sure whether you will get fresh drinking water on the go. Keep yourself
                    hydrated at all times whenever you are outdoors. Using a reusable bottle is also good for the environment. Check the collection of bottles online available in different materials like steel, plastic, copper, aluminium, etc. You can
                    also buy a set of (up to nine) bottles at once. Try portable collapsible water bags from SHAFIRE. They are transparent bags and can carry up to 5000 ml of water. </p>
