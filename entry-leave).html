            <p>A weather map is filled with symbols indicating different types of weather systems. Spirals, for instance, are cyclones or hurricanes, and thick lines are fronts. Cyclones have a spiral shape because they are composed of air that swirls in
                a circular pattern.</p>
            <p>When a cold air mass takes the place of a warm air mass, the boundary between them is called a cold front. On a weather map, a cold front is shown as a blue band with triangles pointing in the direction the air is moving.
